Audience members may expect to be drawn into the start of a story about the process and power of human consciousness, as told through sound, sight, taste, and proprioception, by a collaborative of artists, including vocalist Sarah Fontenelle, musicians Alex Smith, Paul McDonald, Eric Rogers (of the Generationals), and Michael Girardot (of the Revivalists), media artist Andrew Wade Smith (<a href="https://www.processartifact.com/andrew-wade-smith" target="_blank" >Process Artifact</a>), novelist Kristen Illarmo, actor Morla Gorrondona, and inventor of gustatory delights Chef Derrick Toups (Bonne Terre Pop Up).

        <p> Constellations was an animated, interactive celestial skyscape - a cosmic orchestra of light and sound - that debuted at Luna Fete 2017. In this incarnation of the Kirasu universe, participants’ bodies were tracked and transformed into constellations, illuminating the night sky and entangling motion with the stars. The current installation was just one of an infinite number of potential materializations inspired by philosophical musings on the unknown and on what lies beyond.
